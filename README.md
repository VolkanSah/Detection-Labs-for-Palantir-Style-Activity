> [!WARNING]
>  ### **Disclaimer & Project Scope**



This repository (lesson) is strictly for **educational, research, and defensive purposes only**.
**CRITICAL NOTE:** This is a **SAFE SIMULATION** designed to teach defensive concepts. The code is not intended to be, and should never be used as, a functional offensive tool or weapon.

It is NOT a guarantee of security. Cybersecurity is about **reducing risk**, not eliminating it.

The core schematics for understanding the logic are in `README.md`.
Source files and advanced tools are separated for **expert use only**, prioritizing responsible learning over potential misuse.

####  ⚠️ 🛑 OPERATIONAL SECURITY (OPSEC) & LEGAL NOTICE 🛑 ⚠️ 
**READ THIS FIRST. This section supersedes all other documentation.**

This toolkit, including all rules, fingerprints, and simulation scripts, is provided EXCLUSIVELY for **defensive use on networks you are legally authorized to protect.**

#### ABSOLUTELY NO OFFENSIVE USE IS PERMITTED.

**Legal Authority is MANDATORY:** Before any monitoring, testing, or analysis, you must possess **explicit, written, and verifiable legal authority** from the network owner.

**Consequences:** Unauthorized access, monitoring, or testing is strictly illegal and will lead to severe civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment.

By using this repository, you agree you are solely responsible for adhering to all applicable laws and regulations. The project contributors are not liable for any misuse or damage caused by this toolkit.



> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Think before you type!**

💡 Expert Highlight:** Don't miss the **Advanced Jitter Analysis** in the Continuous Monitoring workflow! This logic represents high-fidelity threat hunting and is the most advanced, non-simulated component of this repository.

### **1. Background & Mission**

Technology is never neutral. This project was born from that understanding.

Powerful data analysis and surveillance technology, like that developed by Palantir, is now a globally traded commodity. It is sold to governments and organizations with little to no ethical oversight regarding their human rights records or political objectives. In the hands of democratic states, it promises security. In the hands of authoritarian regimes, it becomes a weapon for the oppression of minorities, journalists, and political dissenters.

**This fundamental imbalance of power is the reason this repository exists.**

Our mission is to help level the playing field. We provide **open-source tools and hands-on labs** to detect the digital fingerprints of these powerful surveillance platforms. By using vendor-agnostic **Sigma rules** and free **SIEM platforms**, we make these detection capabilities accessible to everyone—not just those with nation-state budgets.

This is more than a technical exercise; it is an act of **digital transparency**. The goal is to **empower security analysts, researchers, and defenders** to recognize these patterns, understand their implications, and hold powerful actors accountable. We believe that the best defense against the abuse of surveillance technology is a well-informed, prepared, and ethically-minded community.

### **2. SIEM Basics**

**Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)** tools collect, normalize, and analyze logs from multiple sources (firewalls, servers, endpoints).
Popular options:

* **Elastic Security** – Open source, flexible.
* **Splunk Free** – Industry standard, free tier (500 MB/day).
* **Wazuh** – All-in-one open-source XDR.

### **5. Known White-Label Implementations**

⚠️ SIMULATION NOTICE / HINWEIS ZUR SIMULATION

Please Note: The indicator names listed below (e.g., POLiS, vs-dataharvester, Berlin-7) are FICTITIOUS EXAMPLES (Placeholders) created for this training simulation. They are designed to teach the structure of indicators (IOCs) without exposing classified information or compromising active investigations. Real-world advanced persistent threats (APTs) use generic names (e.g., svchost.exe) to hide. This lab teaches you the logic of detection, using these distinct names to make the learning process easier.

- Zeek with `JA3` script
- Custom Python: `pip install ja3er`

Advanced usage needed? Have a look on [ja3_ja4_guide.md](ja3_ja4_guide.md)

### **8. Sigma Rule Generator**
Create custom detection rules for white-labeled instances:

```python
# tools/generate_sigma.py
agency = input("Agency name: ")
codename = input("Cover name: ")
signature = input("Unique signature (JA3/path/etc): ")

sigma_rule = f"""
title: {agency} {codename} Detection
logsource:
  category: network
detection:
  selection:
    http.user_agent: '*{codename}*'
    ja3_hash: '{signature}'  # Use strongest available indicator
  condition: selection
level: critical
"""

print(f"Generated rule:\n{sigma_rule}")
```

---

### **9. Test Data Simulation**

#### Basic Python Simulator:
```python
# tools/simulate_palantir.py
import requests, time

target_url = "https://gotham.palantir.com/beacon"
headers = {"User-Agent": "Palantir-Custom-Agent/1.0"}

while True:
    requests.post(target_url, headers=headers, data="SIMULATED")
    time.sleep(300)  # 5 minutes
```

#### Advanced Simulation:
```bash
docker run -it --rm palantir-simulator:latest

## **Operational Security (OPSEC) Notice**

**Warning:** Always ensure you have explicit legal authority and proper authorization before monitoring any network, especially those associated with government or corporate entities. Unauthorized monitoring is illegal and can have severe consequences. This toolkit is for defending networks you are authorized to protect, not for offensive operations. Think before you type.
